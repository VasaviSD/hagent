        The previous refinement attempt using prompt3 did not yield a satisfactory fix.
        The Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) reported the following error or counterexample:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```
        The Verilog diff between the fixed and candidate designs is as follows:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        The current Chisel diff between the original and the latest candidate code is as follows:
        ```
        {chisel_diff}
        ```
        Additionally, based on further code analysis, here are new hints extracted from the chisel_original with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {new_hints}
        ```
        Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work?
        Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff

        The Chisel implementation is not equivalent to the updated Verilog.  
        The Verilog implementation has changed as shown in this unified diff:(verilog_diff):
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        We want the Chisel code to reflect those exact changes in the updated verilog. We need to modify the Chisel source so that, when recompiled, the generated Verilog matches the updated Verilog specification exactly—confirmed by a passing Logic Equivalence Check (LEC). The LEC run produced the following error: 
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```
        I’ve marked a context snippet from the Chisel source (with {metadata_context} lines of context):
        ```
        {chisel_subset}
        ```
        Please provide a unified diff that implements all necessary updates to the Chisel code. You may need to modify multiple lines—and even include more than one hunk—to fully match the updated Verilog.
        Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff

        The previous refinement attempts using prompt4 did not yield a satisfactory fix.
        Please generate Chisel diffs that could work. Consider the following:
        The Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) reported:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```
        The Verilog diff is:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        I also provide a subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {chisel_subset}
        ```
        Please output *only* the diffs in unified diff format with only the minimal hunks containing the changed lines.
        No explanation, no commentary, only diffs.

        The current Chisel code does not compile and the following compiler error was reported.

        The current Chisel code is:
        ```
        {current_chisel}

        and the compiler error is:
        ```
        {compiler_error}
        ```
        Please generate a minimal unified diff that fixes the compilation error so that the code can compile.
        Output *only* the diff with no extra commentary.
